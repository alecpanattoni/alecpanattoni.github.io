	<h1>Methods that we used to explore the effect of missingness on fairness</h1>
	<h2>
		Replicating Each Type of Missingness
	</h2>
	<h3>
		MCAR: Missing Completely at Random
	</h3>
	<p>
		In order to replicate this type of missingness, our mcar function simply takes in a user-input probability parameter,
		which designates how likely each value in the attribute is to be missing. This is the simplest form of missingness to
		reproduce, since missingness is completely at random and not dependent on any particular value. Therefore, we can just
		set a threhold and for each tuple, generate a random value between 1 and 100. If the generated value is less than or
		equal to the threshold, the tuple's value can be set to missing, and it remains its original value otherwise. This
		happens for each tuple for the selected attribute.
	</p>
		
	<h3>
		NMAR: Not Missing at Random
	</h3>
	<p>
		In order to generate our NMAR data, we make use of sigmoid function. This is because the sigmoid function conviniently
		produces a value between 0 and 1 (and therefore can be interpreted as a probability). What happens before this is dependent
		on the type of the attribute in which missingness will be generated. If the column is categorical, for each unique
		categorical value, a random z-score is generated from a normal distribution and put into a sigmoid function. This
		will produce a probability for each unique value of the column. If the column is numerical, the z-score of each
		value is determined and passed into a sigmoid function to determine the probability of missingness for each value.
		Whether each value in the column will be missing is determined by the probability generated by the sigmoid function, using
		a threshold as explained previously. The beta value is multiplied by the generated probability as a way to tune how much
		missingness is generated. The higher the beta value (between 0 and 1), the more missingness is generated. 
	</p>
	<h3>
		MAR: Missing at Random
	</h3>
	<p>
		Our MAR data is generated in a very similar way to our NMAR data. The only difference is that the value of the
		column that our attribute is dependent on is used rather than the value of the missingness column itself.
